Regular expression

A regular expression, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp," is a powerful tool used in computer science and programming for pattern matching within strings of text. It allows you to specify a search pattern using a combination of characters and special symbols to match and manipulate text data. Regular expressions are widely used in tasks such as text processing, data validation, search and replace operations, and more.
