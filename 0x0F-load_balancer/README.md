Load Balancer
Load balancing in software engineering refers to the distribution of incoming network traffic or workload across multiple servers or resources to ensure optimal utilization, prevent overload, and enhance the performance, availability, and reliability of a system or application. The primary goal of load balancing is to distribute the workload efficiently among available resources, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck or being overwhelmed.
