In software engineering, SSH stands for "Secure Shell." It is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and manage network devices and servers over an unsecured network. SSH provides a secure and encrypted communication channel between a client and a server, allowing users to authenticate themselves and establish a secure connection.
