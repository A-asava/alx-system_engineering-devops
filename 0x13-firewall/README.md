FIREWALL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly! In software engineering, a firewall is a crucial component of network security designed to monitor, filter, and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The primary purpose of a firewall is to establish a barrier between a secure internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. Firewalls are an essential part of a layered security approach, helping to protect systems and data from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other security threats.
