Approximately 25% of transactions were unsuccessful during the disruption.
Root Cause:

The root cause was traced to a compatibility issue between the payment gateway and a recent API update.
Timeline:

Issue Detection:

First identified at 08:00 UTC through real-time transaction monitoring showing increased error rates.
Detection Method:

Automated monitoring system triggered alerts due to a sudden rise in transaction errors.
Misleading Paths:

Initially suspected a network congestion issue, prompting network diagnostics and bandwidth checks.
Escalation:

Incident escalated to the DevOps team after initial troubleshooting efforts did not reveal the exact cause.
Resolution:

Identified and resolved the compatibility issue between the payment gateway and the API update.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation:

The issue stemmed from a change in the API that was not fully compatible with the payment gateway's validation processes.
Resolution Details:

Rolled back the API update to restore compatibility with the payment gateway, resolving transaction failures.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Enhance monitoring capabilities to promptly detect API compatibility issues.
Implement stricter version control and testing protocols for API updates.
