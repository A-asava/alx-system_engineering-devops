A web server is software that serves as the foundation for hosting websites and delivering content over the Internet. Its primary function is to handle and respond to requests from clients (typically web browsers) by serving web pages, files, or other content. The term "web server" can refer to both the software application and the physical hardware that hosts the server software.

Key features and responsibilities of a web server include:

Request Handling:

HTTP Protocol: Web servers primarily communicate using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure variant, HTTPS. They listen for incoming HTTP requests from clients and respond with the appropriate content. Content Storage and Retrieval:

Document Root: Web servers have a designated directory, often referred to as the "document root," where web content, including HTML files, images, scripts, and other assets, is stored. File Retrieval: When a client requests a specific resource (e.g., a web page or image), the web server locates the corresponding file and sends it back to the client. Processing Dynamic Content:

Server-Side Scripting: Web servers can execute server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Python, or Ruby scripts) to generate dynamic content before sending it to the client. This enables the creation of interactive and data-driven websites. Security:

Access Control: Web servers enforce access control by managing file permissions and defining rules for who can access specific resources. SSL/TLS: Web servers support secure communication through the use of SSL/TLS protocols, providing encrypted connections for data transmitted between the server and clients. Logging and Monitoring:

Logging: Web servers maintain logs that record details about incoming requests, errors, and other relevant information. These logs are useful for troubleshooting, analysis, and security monitoring. Monitoring: Web servers often include tools or integrate with external monitoring solutions to track server performance, uptime, and resource usage. Virtual Hosting:

Virtual Hosts: Web servers support hosting multiple websites on the same physical server by using virtual hosts. Each virtual host has its own configuration and can serve content independently. Load Balancing:

Load Balancers: In large-scale deployments, web servers can be part of a load balancing setup to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This improves performance, redundancy, and scalability. Popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and LiteSpeed. The choice of a web server often depends on factors such as performance requirements, features, and compatibility with specific technologies.
